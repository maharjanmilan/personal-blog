If you are working with people who are at different time zone than yours, you might want to know their local time. Or you might want to call your friend or relative who lives at the other end of the globe, and need to find out whether its sleeping time there. Or you might want to know your local time for your favorite football club's match.

Whatever your case be, it would be helpful to have multiple clocks in your mac.

Although you cannot add multiple timezone clock in the menu bar, you can add _World Clock_ widget in Notification center under _Today_ view.

## Adding Multiple timezone clocks in mac

1. Click on the hamburger menu (icon with three lines) on the top right corner of your mac. This will open _Notifications center._
